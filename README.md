## The Story

> This app was born when I was doing math practice with my daughter and thought: "Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a fun, magical app to make learning math an adventure?" And so, the Math Kingdom was created!

If you have ideas to make it better, please share them on GitHub! Wishing all little mathematicians great success!
